# Product-Recomendation-System

# Overview
This code implements a product recommendation system using a dataset of video game reviews. It leverages natural language processing techniques to generate recommendations based on textual similarity between product reviews.

# Dependencies
Datasets: Used for loading and handling datasets.
Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Employed for text processing and similarity computation.
Surprise: A library for building and analyzing recommender systems. (Note: The installation of Surprise library might require additional dependencies and setup.)

!pip install datasets
!pip install surprise

# Dataset Import
The code imports a dataset of video game reviews from the Hugging Face datasets library. It selects a sample of 100 reviews for demonstration purposes.

# Data Preprocessing
The dataset is converted to a Pandas DataFrame.
Basic exploratory data analysis is conducted to check for missing values and obtain summary statistics.

# Model Creation
The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer is used to transform text data into numerical vectors.
Cosine similarity between text vectors is computed to measure similarity between reviews.

# Recommendation Generation
The get_recommendations function takes a product ID and returns the top N recommended products based on textual similarity.
Recommendations are generated by finding the most similar products to the input product.
